What is lxc:

  The container technology is actively being pushed into the mainstream linux
  kernel. It provides the resource management through the control groups  aka
  process containers and resource isolation through the namespaces.

  The  linux  containers, lxc, aims to use these new functionnalities to pro-
  vide an userspace container object which provides full  resource  isolation
  and resource control for an applications or a system.

  The first objective of this project is to make the life easier for the ker-
  nel developers involved in the containers project and  especially  to  con-
  tinue  working  on  the  Checkpoint/Restart  new features. The lxc is small
  enough to easily manage a container with simple command lines and  complete
  enough to be used for other purposes.

Using lxc:

  Refer the lxc* man pages (generated from doc/* files)

Downloading the current source code:

  Source for the latest released version can always be downloaded from
  http://lxc.sourceforge.net/download/lxc

  You can browse the up to the minute source code and change history online.
  http://lxc.git.sourceforge.net

  For detailed build instruction refer to INSTALL and man lxc man page
  but a short command line should work:
  ./configure && make && sudo make install && sudo lxc-setcap
  preceded by ./autogen.sh if configure do not exist yet.

Getting help:

  when you find you need help, you can check out one of the two
  lxc mailing list archives and register if interested:
  https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/lxc-devel
  https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/lxc-users

Portability:

  lxc  is  still  in  development, so the command syntax and the API can
  change. The version 1.0.0 will be the frozen version.

  lxc is developed and tested on Linux since kernel mainline version 2.6.27
  (without network) and 2.6.29 with network isolation.
  is compiled with gcc, and supports i686, x86_64, ppc, ppc64, S390 archi.
